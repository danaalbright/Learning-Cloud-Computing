# Learning-Cloud-Computing
I am using my time to leverage my technological skills. I keep seeing more and more job listings looking for people experienced in cloud computing. In general, everyone must adapt and keep current with new trends, specially in this tough job market. 

This is where I share what I learn from Cloud Computing.

## Learning Contents
* Technical discussions
  
GitHub is a great place to create code and share it with other people. This repo allows me to store my work. 

* Gists

Gists are small pieces of code. You can create Gists here on GitHub for people to access it. To create a Gist, click the + sign at the top of the page Create and click New Gist.
